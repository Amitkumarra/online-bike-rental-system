            <p>A bike rental system is a service that provides customers with the ability to rent bicycles for a short
                period of time, typically for leisure or transportation purposes. The system is operated by a business
                or government agency, and bikes can be rented from various locations, such as bike stations or stands.
                Customers typically pay a fee based on the length of time they need the bike and can return it to any
                location within the system network. The bike rental system can provide a convenient and eco-friendly way
                to get around, and can be popular in urban areas with extensive cycling infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Rule and Regulation</h2>
            <ol>
                Bike rental rules and regulations can vary from one bike rental company to another, but there are some
                common ones that are usually in place. Here are some of the most common rules and regulations for bike
                rentals: <br><br>

                <li>Age requirement: Most bike rental companies have an age requirement for renters, usually between 18
                    and
                    25 years old.</li>

                <li> ID requirement: Renters are usually required to provide a valid government-issued ID, such as a
                    driver's
                    license or passport, to confirm their identity.</li>

                <li> Helmet usage: Many bike rental companies require renters to wear a helmet while riding the bike.
                    Some
                    companies provide helmets with the rental, while others may require renters to bring their own.</li>

                <li> Insurance coverage: Some bike rental companies provide insurance coverage for renters, while others
                    may
                    require renters to purchase additional insurance.</li>

                <li> Bike usage: Renters are usually expected to use the bike for its intended purpose and to follow all
                    traffic laws. They may also be required to return the bike in good condition and to notify the
                    rental
                    company if there are any issues with the bike.</li>

                <li> Payment terms: Renters are usually required to pay for the rental upfront, and some companies may
                    also
                    require a security deposit.</li>

                <li> Cancellation policy: Some bike rental companies may have a cancellation policy in place, with fees
                    for
                    cancelling or rescheduling a reservation.</li> <br>

                These are just some of the common rules and regulations for bike rentals. It's important to check with
                the specific bike rental company you're interested in to learn about their specific rules and
                regulations.
